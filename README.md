Mini-course on ai expressions: descriptions and examples.

## Introduction to ai expressions (aiE | AiE | AIE)
Before we start with the detailing of definitions, operations, tools, and the associated theoretical and computational machinery, it is essential to set out foundations. In Japanese "Ai" [/ay/] means love. And so, we start with **love**, always.

**ai expressions** is really a playful (and serious) way for the self to make art generation less scary and enjoyable. Making digital art enjoyable and less scary does several things, _which we do not claim to know the scope of consequences of such things at this current point_, but perhaps the essential thing that it does is make interfacing with computational structures for art generation closer to the _soul_ and _mind_ of the animal, plant, machine, and enviornment. 

## A book about aiE, an AGI API
Currently working on a [book](https://storage.googleapis.com/root-proposal-1246/ai-expressions/book_ai_expressions.pdf) for the ai expression framework. This document is being updated constantly so feel free to check often.

## From `ai expression` to programming languages

* See [`ai expressions` for `python programming language`](aie.python.md)

* See [`ai expression` for `R programming language`](aie.R.md)
